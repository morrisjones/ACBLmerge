ACBLmerge changelog

1.3.5 - 2014-11-19
  - Mac OS X is fully supported out of the box.
    - Uses latest DDS 2.7.0 for double dummy calculations.
    - Ships with all necessary dynamic link libraries.
  - Tightened check for Board-A-Match (BAM) games. 'Bam!Berger Future Masters'
    event name was inadvertently tripping the BAM mode.

1.3.4 - 2014-11-07
  - Upgraded to version 2.7.0 of Bo Haglund DDS double dummy solver (dds.dll)
  - Bundled 7-zip and use it to parse the masterpoint database on
    Windows to avoid dependency on unsupported Archive-Lha package.
  - Converted all HTML output, including Pair Recap and Cut-and-Paste Aid
    popups, to HTML5.
  - American Style scoring (-as switch) now also applies to popup recap
    sheets (issue reported by Philippe Lamoise).
  - Added board number "links" from popup recap sheet to main report.
  - Fixed N-S and E-W flip of asymmetric double dummy contract results.
  - Fixed swapped East/West reporting of par contract when East and West
    take a different number of tricks (reported by Randy Dougherty).
  - Fixed several par bugs due to algorithm issues and also faulty
    algorithm optimization (based on reports from Randy Dougherty,
    Jim Bradley, Bo Haglund, Soren Hein, and Philippe Lamoise). Issues
    addressed:
    1. Making contract could be overlooked when a sacrifice in a higher
       denomination was an improvement on the other partnership's contract.
    2. Additional sacrifice contracts in lower ranking denomination(s)
       could be skipped.
    3. Some additional sacrifice contracts were reported in lower ranking
       denominations that other partnership could improve on with a making
       contract.
  - Fixed bug where face view tooltip did not stay anchored at cursor
    location when transitioning to player who have images of differing
    heights.
  - Fixed bug that caused player tooltip to not appear when player's full
    name was more than 22 characters long (reported by Charles Babcock).
  - Fixed incorrect sorting issue for IMP Pairs when scores are -100.00 IMPs
    and lower. Code was only examining last six characters and therefore
    missing the minus sign. (extension of fix in 1.3.0 release)
  - Fixed popup recap sheet bugs for two letter sections (reported by
    Jim Bradley)
  - Fixed bug that caused an extra field to be added to the JSON output
    for PASS OUT results.
  - Made CSS change to prevent winners table from wrapping ugly when window
    is narrow (suggested by Jim Bradley).
  - Prevent possibility of 'Dlr: ' and 'Vul: ' line wrapping after the colon
    which occurred in rare cases (reported by Jim Bradley)
  - Tightened parsing of Overall and Section rankings.
  - Suppressed warning when writing JSON when performing
    Extra Trick Factor (ETF) calculation for doubled contracts.
  - Cleaned up many minor JavaScript issues found with jslint.
  - Exit with a warning if -b option is used with 64-bit Perl on Windows.
  - Added preliminary support for Board-a-Match (BAM) events.

1.3.3 - 2012-07-26
  - Fixed LoTT display (regression in 1.3.2 release)
  - Switched to latest DDS release (2.2.1, 2012-07-16).

1.3.2 - 2012-07-23
  - Added ability to write hands as Bridge Base LIN files.
  - No longer require ACBLscore game file to map player names to 
    player numbers (e.g. -mp and -fs switches) when ACBLscore report
    already contains the player numbers.
  - Enhanced data mining support for pair games to include board
    results, contracts, opening lead, deal, double dummy analysis,
    par contracts, and LoTT and extra trick factor (ETF) calculations.
  - Added -mssurl switch for linking to list of overall section
    and/or session ranks.
  - Added a check for attempts to process multiple events in a single
    ACBLscore report. This is not supported but previously ran and
    created partly broken HTML.

  - Reworded text shown below list of winners for multi-session events.
  - Changed 'Missing hand record' message to 'No hand record'.

  - Fixed bug that caused leading digit of masterpoint awards 10.00
    or higher to be ignored, e.g. and award of 14.78 MP would be.
    reported as 4.78 in the winners lists and in the data mining output.
  - Fixed broken v## team hovering tooltips for team results that
    occurred in certain cases.
  - Fixed bug in creation of hovering tooltip for v## opposing teams
    in team output that could cause partial HTML output.
  - Fixed bug in linking hyperlinking of names in second column
    of non final team game results.
  - Fixed bugs in handling of teams games which include player numbers.
    Datamining JSON and team number tooltip were incorrect.
  - Fixed handling of opening lead display in popup recap sheet for
    Pass Out auctions. Should display nothing but previously displayed
    a lone suit symbol. [reported by Charles Babock]
  - Fixed parsing of movements with more than one word. Previously
    data mining JSON would return only the first word, e.g. 'ONE'
    instead of 'ONE WINNER'.
  - Fixed conversion of 'Regional' --> 'Regionall' in tournament name

1.3.1 - 2012-06-19
  - Fixed bug in iPhone customized output that caused results for
    pairs 2,3,5,6,8,9,etc to go missing if input file does not contain
    cities for each pair.   
  - No longer report missing contract errors if contract in BWS file is
    an empty string and ACBLscore shows a PASS. This is a workaround
    for how the Bridgemate server communicates with ACBLscore.
  - Added a check in playerNumsAndNames() to make sure ACBLscore game
    file seems legitimate, exiting with an error if not.
  - Added very basic JSON support generated by -dm switch for team games
    so that masterpoint awards can be tracked.
  - Made minor improvements to the documentation.

1.3.0 - 2012-02-24
  - Added support for team games.
  - Added option (-w) to display a list of masterpoint winners.
  - Significantly faster double dummy analysis on Windows. Added
    ddsolver.exe for direct access to the latest version (2.1.2) of
    Bo Haglund's double dummy solver DLL (dds.dll).
  - Added Bridgemate / BridgePad support on non-Windows platforms.
  - Added support for "old" Duplimate format (.bri files)
  - Added data mining (-dm) switch. Produces JSON output.

  - Fixed bug in par computation which caused some sacrifices
    in lower ranking denomination to be ignored when a sacrifice
    was found in a higher denomination. The following hand exhibited
    the problem [reported by Larry Sherman]
    AKJ43.9.AJ63.642 75.K7654.4.AQT93 T986.Q8.K872.K75 Q2.AJT32.QT95.J8
  - Fixed incorrect sorting issue for IMP Pairs when scores are -10.00 IMPs
    and lower. Code was only examining last five characters and therefore
    missing the minus sign. [reported by Bruce McIntyre]
  - Fixed issues with popup recap sheets for IMP Pairs.

  - Added support for BridgePad lead card format, i.e. rank-suit,
    as opposed to instead of the suit-rank format used by Bridgemate.
    [reported by David Kopper]
  - Added -as option for "American Style" scoring where the contracts
    made are reported as total number of tricks taken (less book),
    instead of relative to the contract, e.g. "4S E 5" instead of
    "4S E +1" [requested by Joe Steele of Bridgemate]

  - Improved sorting of results. If electronic scoring data is available,
    a secondary sort will be performed on the contracts (descending
    denomination, followed by descending level, followed by seat). If
    opening leads are available, a tertiary sort will be performed on the
    lead (descending suit, descending rank). This looks better when
    there are many results (e.g. big open event at a regional).
  - Changed definition of "top" and "bottom" boards in the popup recap
    sheets to less than 1% and greater than 99% respectively. Previously
    top and bottom were set to 0% and 100%. The new definitions flag boards
    that are not quite 0% or 100% due to how ACBLscore scales results on
    boards that are played a different number of times in different 
    sections or due to irregularities. For example 0.04% is now a "bottom".
  - Removed distracting hyperlink underline from the help link
    question mark box at the upper left corner of the HTML output.

  - Added support CGI hyperlinking of player names for better
    integration with websites, in particular Philippe Lamoise's
    bridgeresults.net
  - Added -txturl and -giburl switches (analogous to -pbnurl switch)
  - Added -appdir option to explicitly define the application
    directory in case HOME environment variable is not defined
    on Unix, e.g. for website backend programming.
  - No longer accept filenames and URLs that begin with a dash for
    switches that require an argument. This minor restriction avoids
    confusion when a switch would be swallowed up as a required argument
    to the previous switch.
  - Added $EXIT_REPROCESS_ERR exit code, distinct from
    $EXIT_ACBLSCORE_PARSE_ERR

  - Fixed HTML Validation issue by removing <form> surrounding button for
    cut-and-paste aid.
  - Made very minor cosmetic changes to HTML output for pairs games
    that do not affect how the result is rendered by browsers.

1.2.3 - 2011-05-22
  - Bug fix: If -fc was specified, but neither -mp nor -fs was
    specified, the faces did not appear in the HTML tooltip.
  - Bug fix: User home directory was incorrectly specified for Unix.
    [reported by Bruce McIntyre]
  - Download Club Update Database to per user application specific
    folder, consistent with similar changes made in version 1.2.0
  - Changed code to use hex() function in a few places for better
    readability. [suggested by Roman Kaluzniacki]
  - Eliminated Perl warnings (via -w Perl switch) generated when 
    reading DUP files.

1.2.2 - 2011-04-24
  - Fixed incorrect handling of passed out hands in Contract column
    of HTML output (was okay in popup recap sheets).
  - Bug fix: Contract was not included in iPhone customized HTML output
    for single section events other than A section.
  - Fixed bug where if a game file was specified for any switch that
    required a game file (-fc, -fs, -mp) but not for last such switch,
    the program would mistakenly try to use the default filename. This
    bug usually only affected big tournaments, e.g. regionals, where
    games files are often named something like 18AFT.ACA instead of
    YYMMDD.ACA.
  - Changed code to handle arbitrary white space around Bridgemate /
    BridgePad section designations. Originally handled case of a single
    trailing space but then a case with two trailing spaces appeared.

1.2.1 - 2011-03-25
  - Fixed bug that prevented electronic scoring from being included in
    single section events other than section 'A'.
  - Fixed bug that prevented tooltip from working in iPhone output.
  - Tightened HTML output to eliminate some issues detected by the Total
    Validator Tool.

1.2.0 - 2011-03-21
  - Added ability to include contract and opening lead from Bridgemate
    and BridgePad electronic scoring equipment. See -b option
  - Added -fs option for field strength calculation (average and geometric
    mean of MP holdings of all players)
  - Added -mp option to show player masterpoint holdings via tooltip
    when mouse is held over a player name
  - Added -fc option to display faces when mouse is held over a player name
  - Added reading and writing of double dummy results from/to PBN files in
    OptimumResultTable.
  - Added Bridgify format to Cut-and-Paste aid to help users who are not
    given a PBN link or have a broken one because the ACBLmerge user
    forgot to upload the PBN file.
  - Recovered some screen real estate by wrapping long double dummy make
    lines (caused by lots of contracts that make a different number of
    tricks from each side).
  - Change to per user application specific folder (%APPDATA\ACBLmerge or 
    ~/.ACBLmerge) for application data, i.e. masterpoint database download
    and temporary file created during double dummy analysis, so that users
    can use all program features even if they can not write to the
    application directory.
  - Added question mark help box at upper left corner of report to make
    "Explanation of report features" standout more.
  - Removed copyright message. It was a legal remnant that should have
    been removed after adopting the GNU General Public License GPLv3
    license several versions ago.

1.1.3 - 2010-12-17
  - Fixed issue where ACBLmerge would claim certain ACBLscore files were
    not valid ACBLscore report files because they contained a pseduo-tag
    like <!A137059>. Usually ACBLscore creates pseudo-tags like <!A>. But
    sometimes it includes the club number (observed in the output for a
    STAC game).
  - If -hurl is not specified, the help URL will be created and point to:
    http://lajollabridge.com/Software/ACBLmerge/ACBLmergeReport.htm
    Use new -nohurl switch to completely suppress the help link.
  - Added -pbnurl for specifying location of PBN file on the website
    if it will not be placed in same location as HTML file.
  - Now only strip path from PDF filename if it is a Windows specific
    style path; otherwise leave alone anything that could be a valid
    hyperlink.
  - Added :crlf Perl I/O layer for proper handling of files with Windows
    CR LF line termination when running from Unix.
  - Added -crlf switch to control line termination of output files.

  - Very minor edits to ACBLmergeReport.htm
  - Additions to ACBLmergeAbout.htm. Added command line help summary,
    line termination explanation, how to start a DOS shell on Vista
    and Windows 7, and the importance of placing all output files in
    the same folder on your website (except when overridden by -pbnurl
    and/or -pdf options).
  - zip and tar archive filename now include program version, i.e.
    ACBLmerge113.zip instead of just ACBLmerge.zip

1.1.2 - 2010-04-16
  - Fixed numerous problems with popup recap sheets generated for Howell
    (one winner) movements due to a bug in ACBLmerge.js

1.1.1 - 2010-04-13
  - Fixed bugs introduced in version 1.1.0 when multiple CPUs are used
    to perform double dummy analysis. 

1.1.0 - 2010-04-07
  - Add recap sheets for each pair (click on pair number for popup)
  - Fixed iPhone output in dumpHTML() to accommodate changes in
    ACBLscore 7.60 (released  Mar 21, 2009) and other minor problems
    with iPhone output. Since ACBLscore 7.60, the player numbers
    and player cities are no longer listed.
  - No longer include blank line between each pair result in regular
    HTML output.
  - iPhone filename is now based on output filename rather than the
    ACBLscore results filename. This makes a difference when the output
    filename is specified rather than automatically generated from the
    ACBLscore results filename. Ex: foo.htm generates foo_iphone.htm.
  - Fixed "Jump directly to board" navigation which broke in IE8. This
    seems to be due to a bug in IE8 where named anchors to blank
    sections do not work, e.g. a <tr> containing nothing except other
    tags.
  - Add option (-tm) to put a center marker (green square) in the middle
    of every hand layout (requested by Rich DeMartino)
  - Added HTML check boxes to iPhone output to hide either all boards
    (+ analysis) or all results for all boards.
  - Fixed bug in readPBN() that caused PBN read to fail if there was
    extra white space at the end of the PBN file.
  - Fixed bug that caused hang in par() on par zero deals.
  - Cleaned up display of hot deals, i.e. where  both sides can make
    best contract.
  - Added ability for user to inject custom the HTML (e.g. banners,
    menu bars, footers, etc via the -ih, -isb, and -ieb switches.
  - Wrapped ACBLmerge output in <div id="ACBLmerge"> tag to better support
    functionality provided by the new -ih, -isb, and -ieb switches.

  - Many changes to ACBLmergeAbout.htm
  - Minor edits to ACBLmergeReport.htm and included a link to par zero
    deals on Thomas's Bridge Fantasia.

  - Changed some informative messages to print to STDERR so that when
    output is directed to STDOUT (i.e. no -o switch) these messages
    will be in a separate steam (most informative messages were already
    directed to STDERR).
  - Define numerous exit codes ($EXIT_FOO) for better logging when run
    as part of a pipeline.
  - Cleaned up command line help slightly.
  - CSS and JavaScript is now stored in separate ACBLmerge.css and
    ACBLmerge.js files respectively instead of directly in the perl
    script using HEREDOC notation. This change makes it easy to validate
    CSS and JavaScript changes.
  - Changed threads::joinable to 0 for compatibility with Perl 5.6 and
    5.8 which do not defined threads::joinable in threads.pm
  - No longer print out path to ddd.exe (or ddd) when performing double
    dummy analysis.
  - Hands are now stored in a hash (%hd) instead of an array (@hd). This
    provides a bit more flexibility and is consistent with treatment of
    board results (%br).

1.0.8 - 2009-05-04
  - Added multiple CPU (core) support for faster double dummy analysis
    See -c option. It sure is fast on a quad core Dell Precision M6400!
  - Added JavaScript code to ordinary HTML page to automatically switch
    to iPhone page when iPhone/iPod client seen and the iPhone version
    is being generated (via -iphone).
  - Created a program logo and updated ACBLmergeAbout.htm documentation.
  - Fixed bug that prevented created of link to text version of ACBLscore
    output if input was ABCLscore HTML and -txt option was specified.
  - Fixed bug that caused input HTML file to be overwritten instead of
    first being renamed .orig.htm if .htm extension was not entirely
    lower case.
  - Fix for erroneous reporting of that input file is not in ACBLscore
    traveler report.

1.0.7 - 2009-04-11
  - Fixed bug that prevented processing certain combined session events.
  - Gracefully handle case of missing hand records for individual hands
    (e.g. board #37 when a standard set of 36 is created with Dealmaster)
  - Strip repeated DATE> and DIR> lines from all but the first section
    header in the HTML output.
  - Add a command line option (-pbnevt) to explicitly define the Event
    Name written in PBN output (default action is use Event Name in the
    ACBLscore output).
  - Significantly improved iPhone customized HTML output.
  - Add explanations of new command line switches to ACBLmergeAbout.htm
  - If report filename is HTML, rename original to foo.orig.htm instead
    of clobbering it.
  - Fixed issues creating iPhone HTML output when input file is HTML.

1.0.6 - 2009-04-07
  - First attempt at an iPhone customized HTML output (-iphone switch)
  - Fixed bug which generated 8 level sacrifice as the par contract,
    e.g. 8D*-EW-6. Amusingly, long ago the official rules of bridge
    did not prohibit bidding beyond 7N, but that loophole was fixed.
  - For double dummy analysis, ddd.exe will now first be searched for
    in the same directory containing the Perl script (this simplifies
    deployment); otherwise it relies on the OS to search the system
    path (as before).
  - Write link to PBN and/or GIB file if supplied hand records are in
    PBN or GIB format even if -p or -g options respectively are not
    supplied.
  - Add -pdf options to create link to PDF version of hand records.
  - Add ability to process HTML files generated by ACBLscore (these
    are basically the same as the text output with a <pre> tag slapped
    around the text.
  - Added informative error messages if ACBLscore report is not in
    the correct format or isn't even an ACBLscore output file.
  - Addressed three minor JavaScript lint issues found by CSE Validator
    Std 9.01.
  - Fixed bug which caused 'Unrecognized Switch' message when strings
    are encountered which are not switches and are not used as an argument
    to a switch. Changed error message to 'Unexpected string: foo (ignored)'.
  - Code now complies with 'use strict' pragmas.

1.0.5 - 2008-10-13
  - Suppress a warning generated when reading a board from a
    Duplimate file where the last hand (west) contains void(s)
    in the lowest ranking suit(s).
  - Leave [Site] field out of PBN file if Club information is
    absent in ACBLscore report.
  - Parse "Club No." field from and include it as a comment in
    PBN output.
  - Fixed bug that caused link to PBN file to be incorrect in
    some cases (was not correctly stripping file path).
  - Change message next to PBN hyperlink because "Save Link As..."
    in Firefox is "Save Target As..." in IE.

1.0.4 - 2008-10-08
  - Fixed parameter passing issues. Due to Perl's unusual scoping
    rules the code behaved correctly but not for the reasons one
    would expect by naively examining the code. The changes put the
    code on a sounder footing.
  - Fixed a few typos (mostly in comments)
  - Delete temporary file generated by double dummy calculation
  - Temporary filename is now process dependent, i.e. ddd$$.tmp
    to reduce chance of collision if multiple instances are run.
  - Provide an informative message if ddd.exe can not be found.
  - Declare HTML output to be English, i.e. <html lang="en">

1.0.3 - 2008-09-29
  - Fixed incomplete reporting of par contract(s) in certain
    circumstance when par score was +110 or -110.
  - Added comment in HTML output identifying result as having been
    generated by ACBLmerge

1.0.2 - 2008-09-28
  - Fixed two warnings generated on hands with void suit(s). These
    warnings did not cause the code to malfunction because Perl treats
    undef as 0 in a numeric context.
  - Added information about required ACBLscore output to Perl help
    displayed when no arguments are supplied
  - Added some informative messages (sent to STDERR)
  - Added -v (version) and -q (quiet) switches

1.0.1 - 2008-09-25
  - Original version
